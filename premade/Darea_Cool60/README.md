# DAREU COOL 60

Preamble:
I mainly use a keyboard for programming, text typing and editing, and OS operations. I normally use ergonomic keyboards and am pretty deep into remapping. When I game I almost exclusivly do so wiuth a controller. But when Dareu asked me if I wantred to revfiew this new boawrd of theirs, I clearly said sdyes, as I'm keyboard curious and don't know anything about HE boards. They asked me to mention taht it's on sale from Nov mioa on their Amazon shop DAREU GAMING. So now you knnow :)

## First thoughts:

Alright, it sounds surprisingly well out of the box! Zero stabilizer rattle. Okay! No mods that *needs* doing -- nice!

Nice that they've placed arrow keys on the right-hand ?-Alt-Menu-Ctrl keys. The manual doesn't mention Fn-lock, but I'd like to lock Fn so I always have arrow keys. Hm, it doesn't mention firmware either.

The product website didn't mention firmware either, but I found Google led me to their [driver's page](https://dareu.com/en-eu/pages/driver), where I see the Cool60 is supported by the [ALL in one WEB configurator](https://dr.dareu.com/). Nice, it works in Chromium on Linux.
No reason to bust out my emergency Windows 12.5" ThinkPad X250.

All, right, checking out the web configurator. Seems like there are two layers available, Standard and Fn Mode. In Fn mode, some keys are locked -- cannot be remapped: Tab, W, }, Win, Space and Fn itself. Hm, okay. So I cannot implement my default SpaceFn, as that would have me remap W to Workspace Up.

Well, I can remap . to Backspace on Fn, that should make editing easier, though I still have to hold down Fn with my pinky. Done.

Clicking around, I see it also has it also has three profiles available. And I can remap to switch betweeen them. So I can set up a profile with arrow keys on the Standard layer. Then toggle between them, if need be. It's not exactly Layer-Tap freedom. Oh well.

There are also some advanced keybindings. DKS, MT, TGL, and SOCD.

## Day Two
Okay, I'll start by setting up a diufferent profile so I can eidt my text without having to hold Fn. 

Doen. I dset up a key dso I can swiotch to Profile 2, and added arrow keysw to where they are on the Profile 1 Fn layer. That took a few minutes, but was eawswy enough. There's a Record option for remapping, so dI didn't have to scroll through dropdown menus to find the keys.

It's very interesting to rwirte on tthis baord. It'd very, very smooth in it's linearity. I'm used to tactiles , so it'd qquite a difference. Profile 2 is also set to trigger after 1mm, so I get a lot of mispresses by even just rewsting my fingers on the kieysw. Fun!

Ah, travel is adjustable per key, and wasd are set even lower. That's why a they reacto sooo much. I'll edit those mispresses out later.a

Let's atake a look at some of those firmware options.

Key Functions, the "Advanced Key"

DKP -- Dynamic dKey PAthKS: A single key acheives 4 functions: you can bind 1 to 4 fucntions. 

Okay, on the number one, I've assigned M I A W so the first are triggered during down, the alast on up. Let's give it a quick tap: mmiiaao. Ah yes, it'd divided into 7 parts, and I assigned MIA two each. Not each is only one, lets try again: miao. LOL. momomomomomiaomomiaomomiaomiaomiao. Ha. Oaky, that's fun. It works well, very smooth. EEasy enough tod configre.

MT (Hold-Click). I've tried this the other day. It's fine. If you hold the key after a aper-key timeout (per -key: taht's nice), it sends on key, if you poress it shorter it sends another. Fine.

TGL (Toggle Switch): Click it for continuous triggering, hold for normal triggering. Okay, let's try thatMIAO. Ha. Oh yeah, I remmpaed the one key before. Now I've set TWO to be o. I'll tap it. ooooooooooooooo. DI't trigfgered after a swmall delay. Can't turn the timeout down furhter. Okay, let me try again, while I roll on jkl. ojkl. Okay, tehre I tapped TWO with my right hand, then roilled jkl witht he same. So other keys cancel the continious triggering.

SOCD: "The sSOCD mode has a faster key switching aspeed than dtthe normal mode, and performs better in reverse operation of the game." I don't really know exactly wehat that's suppose to doa, abut then I'm not a gamer.


Let'd turn to LED. It's been waving in my face long nough now. Quite pleasasntly, though. The half-translucent , smokeyakeycaps are make the RGB quite funa (I normally avoid laights on my boards). Alright, ehre are some stadard asett-key angs, adifferent effects, speed, brigthness. It's per preofile, so it can be used to indicate that. Cool. There's no per-key settign for static light. Thatr woulkd have been nice.

Ok, finally, Macros. 

The recordiong and editiong feature works well. You can record, either recoording delay or da fixed one. Individdual delays can be ditred after. Recorded items cdan be deleted from the macrops, and new individual clicks can be inserted. Ok, seems like a nice implementationMIAO. HaMIAO

I've recoired Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V macros, saved tghem to device. Couldn't rename them, so they are just called Macro One Two (efit). That's under Key Function, not under Key Binding where DK=PS, MT, TGL and SOCD resides. Ok, that's something one will learn I guess. Remapping is easy, but it'd have abeen nice with macro names. I remember what One and Two are now, but I can see I'd forget. Remappings sasved, let
''s try: Nice, it works works works works works.

Cool, that's a configurator wrun-down then. It's not QMK in a text editor or Vial, but it seems really reasonableMIAO

I'll aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao a commiot of this, then edit it foadr theddddddddddd mispresses thbat I'v emanaged to make on these super sensitive switches with my used-to-co9lumnstagger fingers :D
