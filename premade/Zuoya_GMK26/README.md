## Introduction

More photos in the bottom.

Two top right keys can be replaced with a 2u Backspace. The platecannot accommodate a stabliziser there, and none was included.

## Out of the box
Stablizers are rattle-free. I hear no pings from the switches, neither when in place or when held to ear. The keycaps are dye-sub, with very clean legends everywhere.

Personally, I think the default sound profile is nice. Not the deepest, but not overly sharp. It's not quite.

## VIA
The macropad works with VIA, and that's nice.

1. Download the latest version of the JSON file: [**ZUOYA_GMK26.json**](ZUOYA_GMK26.json) from this repository.  
   This file is sourced from the official [ZUOYA firmware downloads page](http://zuoya.top/qdxz_04161229_941).

   > ⚠️ If this JSON file doesn't work with your keyboard, you might have an older version of the hardware.  
   > In that case, try using one of the older JSON files available in the current folder

2. Open [usevia.app](http://usevia.app) in a Chromium-based browser.
3. Under`Settings`, activate `Show Design tab`.
4. Load the JSON file:
    - Go to the design tab.
    - Check that V2 definitions are disabled.
    - Drag-n-drop or `Load` the downloaded JSON file.
    - > **Optional**: Toggle `Split Backspace og Big Spacebar` to your liking. This can always be changed under `Configure > Layouts`.
5. Go to the `Configure` tab, authorize and remap your makropad!

> ### VIA errors on Linux
> If you get errors in VIA reading
> - `NotAllowedError: Failed to open the device`, and
> - `Received invalid protocol version from device`, then:
> 1. Open a tab to `chrome://device-log/` and look for `Failed to open '/dev/hidraw1': FILE_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, perhaps with another number than `1`.
> 2. In terminal, run `sudo chown $USER:$USER /dev/hidraw1` (with the right number).
> 3. Reload the VIA page and re-authorize the board.

## QMK?

### Source from Zuoya

The official ZUOYA Store on AliExpress sells this macropad stating that it supports **"QMK/VIA"**. I've contacted the store to see if I can get a hold of some QMK source code, because being able to flash a home-compiled QMK firmware would give me ~~satisfaction.~~ a sense of power. Honesty first. 

_Update 1_:
 An inquiry about both VIA JSON and QMK source was replied to with a promise that they send it to my email. It never arrived, on either of the mails I provided. I've send a number of reminders, and have now opened a refund request, citing missing items. 

_Update 2:_
I was just asked to return it. I didn't, as it's for a friend. I gave up on the communication.

> TODO: Write a review on AliExpress scolding them.

_Update 3:_
> TODO: Add screenshot of conversation from Alibaba where Zuoya rep concludes with "sorry".

### Real QMK?

[u/ArgentStonecutter](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArgentStonecutter/) suggested to test whether the pad is running real QMK underneath (or some alternative firmwware that can be interface with VIA). [Their suggested test](https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetKeebs/comments/1gd85lo/comment/lu0u5hz/) is to check whether tap-hold keys are supported. Gladly, they are: through `Special > Any`, I assigned a key `LT(1, KC_BSPC)`. I send `Backspace` when tapped, and activated `Layer 1` when held. This doesn't prove that the pad runs QMK underneath of course, but it fails to prove that it doesn't.

If it does run QMK, Zuoya should release the source code [to not violate the license as they seemingly are already](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/24085).
