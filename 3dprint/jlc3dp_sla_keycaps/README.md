# Comparision of JLC3DP SLA materials for keycaps

## Introduction
I'm fond of the [Contoured Low Profile (CLP) keycaps](https://github.com/vvhg1/clp-keycaps) on my [LaserRaven](/homemade/laserraven/README.md). I really like the slanted keys for the extra ring finger key and the lower pinky key. I have printed a set at home, on my FDM printer, using a 0.2mm nozzle and PLA. I'm sure it could have gone better: I found it difficult and time-consuming. Also, not very durable. I broke the stems of some. I did do the set soon after I got my new-to-me Ender-3 S1 Plus. Prints have become easier since. So some may have been a skill issue. 

As I'm reworking the LaserRaven into a split, I needed new keycaps, for myself and possibly for builds for others. A bit dismayed at printing them myself and have seen others with resin or nylon keycaps, I started looking for SLA print services locally and abroad, and into material choices. Long story short, I noticed that JLCPCB now have a 3D printing service, too, called JLC3DP that offer both resin and nylon SLA. And several different black resins. So I took a chance and wrote them an email, asking whether they'd support me testing a selection of their black materials for keycaps.

JLC3DP very kindly aggreed, and have sponsored the keycaps you see here on the condition that I write about them and the ordering experience. I was for sure going to do that anyway, but I'd maybe have given printing myself another go, as I'm trying to not sink too much money into this hobby. Especially since I didn't know what material to choose. Well, in that regard, I hope this write-up can help someone else.

## Ordering process
Ordering really is super simple, but it is *a lot* cheaper if you have assembly files of up to 10 keycaps in a grid [like these](https://github.com/vvhg1/clp-keycaps/tree/main/stl/assemblies). You can read about requirements on [this JLC3DP documentation page](https://jlc3dp.com/help/article/Connected-Parts-Printing-Guide), which---by the way---their live chat pointed me towards when I asked how I could get cheaper prints. You can batch multiple prints in one order, so one shipment. Up to 36 different file/material combinations.

Anyways, once you have your file, you really just upload it, choose quantity, material and finishing (I used default finishing for each of the four options I tried). And a product description (I used Office Appliances and Accessories > Plastic Keycaps). Once uploaded, it'll preview your file. You can get a good overview of all uploaded files under your Order History, something the support chat pointed me to. There, you can also see a price for each model/material/quantity you've added. And you can also add and remove.

When your satified, you submit your models for review, where you may get some comments. I got some about wall thickness that chose to accept. During the entire process, you can contact support via the chat, which is not AI. They helped me with quite a lot of stuff, including some quantaty changes that I couldn't make after review. That level of support was really nice, I think. When done, you pay---including import tax to Denmark for me, which is nice, as might else be charged a fee locally, on top of the VAT.

After payment, production starts. I got a number of email notifications about prints having failed, and therefore of delay of my batched order. When production was done, they shipped it off, and I got them all in one joint package.

Done. Easy.

## Nylon vs. three types of resin
But what material? That was my big question. I knew I wanted black, and that was about it. I'd read online that nylon could have a rougher texture than resin, and maybe more grayish. On the JLC3DP site, the _Imagine Black_ resin sounded blacker than the cheaper _Black Resin_, that they described as "grayish black". Then there was _JLC Black Resin_, which was cheaper than _Imagine Black_, and also sounded black. There was also a second nylon, but it was supposedly stiffed, so I feared perhaps easy to break. And not bio-degradable, like the _PA11-HP_. So I went with those four.

In bullets:
- The three resins are all slightly translucent. The nylon is not.
- _Imagine Black_ and _JLC Black Resin_ are equally black (to me), _Black Resin_ a bit grayish.
- _PA11-HP_ nylon is structured in surface, the resins are not. Homing marks a noticable on all four materials, but more on resins.
- _PA11-HP_ nylon keycaps slide onto stems quite easily, but stick in place when I shake and slap the board. They are easier to pull off than regular keycaps.
- _Imagine Black_ had to be forced onto the stems. It pulled stem out of HE switches when I tried to get them off.
- _JLC Black Resin_ and _Black Resin_ feel pretty keycap standard.

I got a full set of _PA11-HP_ nylon keycaps and a full set of _Imagine Black_. For prolonged testing, I wish I'd gotten one _PA11-HP_, one _JLC Black Resin_. I am curious to see what happens to a _Imagine Black_ keycap if I massage it some on a switch stem, break it in a bit.

## Usage
- Day 1: Today I switched to the _PA11-HP_ nylon keycaps on my office board. I'm enjoing the structure, and have had no issues with looseness.

## Photos
I've take photos during the day in the window in Danish winter light, and in more the more natural keyboard habitat of the evening in front of my screen with my Philips Hue bulbs set to just bright white. For the daytime photos, I tried to take comparing shots very quickly after each other, so the cloud wouldn't affect the light much. I also include one with RGB backlight board, to give an impression of the translucency.

Prior to photographing them, I wiped all tops with a wet baby wipe, and let them dry. On the underside shots, you can tell they still have some whatever that stuff is on them.
