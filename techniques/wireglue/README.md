# Wire Glue™: Will it Keyboard?
Wire Glue™ promises to electrically conductively bond low voltage electrical connection. If wants to avoid soldering (for whateever reasons), does wire glue offer an alternative?

[u/infamouslySIN](https://www.reddit.com/user/infamouslySIN/) of [r/keebgirlies](https://www.reddit.com/r/keebgirlies/) have been brainstorming low entry barrier options for handwiring keyboards. Not having to solder seems like something that would make building a board easier for a larger group of people. So I bought this stuff to do some tests, thinking to use it in a [guide for a first handwired](homemade/my_first_handwired/README.md).

## Test 1. LED board
In my first attempt with the wire glue, I wired up an RGB LED to a button cell battery and three switches so my daughter could control the LED color. I messed up the wiring and moved on.

Where the wiring was in order, I saw that:
- The wire glue conducted.
- There was resistance in the connection (maybe the glue): the LED was notably dimmer compared to directly touching it's legs to the battery.

 Three notes on use:
- I spilled some when I opened the jar: the glue separates and gets a very watery top.
- It requires quite some stirring before first use, and later.
- It applies like... egg yolk? Maybe a bit thinner.

## Test 2. Connecting Switches
To test whether the wire glue is conductive enough for a keyboard matrix, I glued three switches to an old, desoldered Havit KB435L PCB I had lying around. I let it cure over night.

Observations:
- The wire glue works for establishing connection between switches and PCB. At least the maybe 200 keypresses I tried all registered without issue.
- It's not a strong adhesive: a switch came off the second time I pulled the keycap off it, me grabbing the PCB and keycap (no plate).The glue explicitly states that one should use e.g. super glue to strengten bonds, so I don't hold it against it.
- I applied glue twice to every join. I should perhaps have applied less.
- It seems to have come off the off'ed switch and PCB easily (cotton swap + isopropyl alcohol). I didn't try soldering after, but the surfaces look clean enough.

## 3. Open Questions:
- Will super-gluing hotswap socket to a PCB with wire glue on the pads be strong enough?
