A one-piece case and a controller cover for the Silakka54 in its unofficial AliExpress v1.3 edition.

The version number is printed on the PCB under the controller. The v1.3 has soldered spacers, unlike the v1.2.

The case reuses the bottom plate from the Silakka54 sandwich case. The cover reuses both switch plate and bottom plate.

Does it have supertight margins for USB and TRRS so it can fit versions with very small handles? No :)
