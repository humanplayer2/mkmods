# My First Handwired Keyboard
*A low-cost, craft-material, solder-free DIY keyboard project*

# >>> still at a brain-storming stage

For now, see [Frejas Hitbox](/homemade/frejas/README.md), [Hama beads plate](/techniques/hama_plate/README.md) and [WireGlue tests](/techniques/wireglue/README.md).

## Questions

- What layout? Like [Frejas Hitbox](/homemade/frejas/README.md), without rotation?
- What MCU and how to fix MCU to Hama case/plate?
- How to draw Hama bead patterns?

## Crafting Materials
- Hama beads, 2 plates
- Acrylic paint (for insulation)
- Screws (xyz, fit into beads)

## Tools
- Clothing iron (for beads case and plate)
- Cutters  (for wire)
- Screwdriver (with xyz bit, given screws)
- Computer (for flashing firmware)

## Electronic Components
- Micro-controller unit (MCU)
- Wire Glueâ„¢
- Wire (must be conductive, e.g. from xyz)
- n switches
- n xyz diodes
- n keycaps
