## 1. LED board
In my first attempt with the wire glue, I wired up an RGB LED to a button cell battery and three switches so my daughter could control the LED color. I messed up the wiring and moved on.

Where the wiring was in order, I saw that:
- The wire glue conducted.
- There was resistance in the connection (maybe the glue): the LED was notably dimmer compared to directly touching it's legs to the battery.

 Three notes on use:
- I spilled some when I opened the jar: the glue separates and gets a very watery top.
- It requires quite some stirring before first use, and later.
- It applies like... egg yolk? Maybe a bit thinner.

## 2. Adhering Switches
To test whether the wire glue is conductive enough for a keyboard matrix, I glued three switches to an old, desoldered Havit KB435L PCB I had lying around. I let it cure over night.

Three observations:
- The wire glue works for establishing connection between switches and PCB. At least the maybe 200 keypresses I tried all registered without issue.
- It's not a strong adhesive: a switch came off the second time I pulled a keycap off it, holding in the PCB and keycap (no plate).The glue explicitly states that one should use e.g. super glue to strengten bonds.
- I reapplied. I should perhaps have applied less.

I wonder:
- How difficult will it be to clean this stuff off if one wants to solder instead?
- Will super-gluing hotswap socket to a PCB with wire glue on the pads work?
